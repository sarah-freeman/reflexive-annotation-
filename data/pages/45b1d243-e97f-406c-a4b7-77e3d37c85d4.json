          "text": "Annotation is one of John Unsworth’s scholarly primitives, processes that form the basis of academic knowledge production across disciplines. Although primarily considered an affordance of print texts, it’s also useful for work with digital sound recordings. In the realm of digital (digitized and/or born-digital) sound, annotation manifests in diverse forms from metadata that provides contextualizing information, to transcriptions which remediate sound, to personal timestamped notes. Typically, annotation is theorized as paratext, marginalia, and/or metadata, the first two terms prioritizing its function as document of “authorial intention,” and the latter as a means of making an item “system-aware” (Clement and Fischer, par. 1, par. 3). However, recent scholarship has produced both theories and case studies reframing annotation as a critical-interpretive practice in itself. For instance, Clement and Fischer’s “audiated annotation” highlights the critical significance of “unauthorized, distributed, and decentralized” annotations as a means of accessing audio when the sound itself is unavailable (par. 4). Because annotation is not an ahistorical, incidental consequence of interacting with audio digitally but rather an artifact of a given listening situation, it holds the possibility of critical reflexivity toward an audiotext and its various forms of mediation. Viewed this way, annotation moves beyond an objective or merely representative practice of indexation. It is constitutive, a perceptual construct that itself produces the audiotext."

Reflexivity often refers to circular, recursive, or self-referential processes of (re)interrogation. As opposed to framings of annotation as stable objects of study and/or use, a reflexive approach frames annotation as a decentralized, subjective process. I consider my own role as an annotator with respect to the normative social and technological paradigms of listening to sound, processing representations of sound, and writing about sound in/through which I work. I identify three areas of annotation—description, indexing, and paratext—through which I encounter both the audiotext and these norms of working with sound. (To be clear, I approach paratext as a feature of annotation, distinct from the use I introduced in the previous paragraph, in which annotation is theorized as paratext.) Given my central thesis—that annotation reconstitutes the audiotext—this isn’t just a matter of becoming aware of how I relate to sound, and through which social and technological avenues. It’s a matter of responsibility, of deciding how I use vocabulary, timestamps, and paratext to ethically reconstitute the audiotext. “Understanding is a process,” writes Charles Husband, “and as such it is a catalyst that actively, even dangerously, interacts and changes whatever it comes into contact with” (qtd. in Lipari 183). Here, I ask: how does my use of description, indexing, and paratext interact with the audiotext? What does it mean to act reflexively, through these practices? And how can I mobilize these concerns toward a usable audio annotation methodology?"

          "text": "I’ve defined reflexivity as responsibility to the relations of annotation. I therefore begin from Lisbeth Lipari’s understanding of responsibility (through listening) as “a posture of receptivity that can receive the other without assimilation or appropriation” (197). Because this is an intersubjective approach, I must not begin with a specific method or theory into which the audiotext is subsumed. Rather, I start with an aim of “creat[ing] a dwelling space to receive the alterity of the other and let it resonate” (198). Listening to alterity is a political activity. Dylan Robinson notes the extractive tendencies of settler colonial “hungry listening,” in which the encounter with sound is not an intersubjective meeting but a hierarchical relationship in which the listener has the power to “dismiss, affirm, or appropriate sound as content” (16). This type of listening is upheld through the categorization of sound into identifiable “formal structures, generic features, or particular musical representations and characterization” (50). Robinson explains: \"this ‘listening for’ satiates through familiarity (to feel pleasure from the satisfaction of identification and recognition) but also through certainty (to feel pleasure from finding the ‘fit’ of content within a predetermined framework)\" (50-51). The utility of “listening for” schemes is evident in annotations of audio, particularly when those annotations purport to directly describe or transcribe the audio event. With a pre-established vocabulary of terms which can be indexed to audio, annotation can reach toward the rationalized settler “construct of the hearing ear as something operational, quantifiable, and separable from subjective experience” (Sterne 68). Set vocabularies, units for quantification of sound, and other abstractions of sound are so enticing because they obscure the friction that characterizes the encounter with alterity. Because these ways of representing sound are the most widely intelligible to sound authorities (both human and technological) they are discursively normalized as ahistorical and objective. This is both false and prohibitive of an intersubjective encounter between listener and audio. That is, if I don’t consider my representation of sound subjective, then my responsibility to the audiotext becomes nebulous and cursory because it cannot actually impact my annotations."

I encounter sound, but I also encounter vocabularies of sound; Audacity, an audio editing app that I use for playback; and AVAnnotate, the web platform I use to publish my annotations. In considering the composite of all of these encounters I follow Jerome McGann treatment of texts as “autopoietic mechanisms” which operate through “linguistic and bibliographical codings” and “cannot be separated from those who manipulate and use them” (15). While McGann’s theory is focused on print texts, I extend it into the audio realm by discussing three of the codes through which annotation reconstitutes sound: description, indexing, and paratext. Each of these is an interface by which I gain representational access to sound: I describe sound through vocabulary, I create timestamps using Audacity, and I create paratext using AVAnnotate. When I refer to the audiotext, I refer to all of these interfaces at which (physical, vibrational) sound gains representative meaning. “The audiotext,” writes Jason Camlot in Phonopoetics, “is an interpretive concept by which sound is conceptualized as a signal with ideational, aesthetic, social, cultural, and formal qualities of historical significance” (11). To encounter an audiotext is to encounter each of these qualities, and to reconstitute it through description, indexing, and paratext is to reconstitute each of these qualities (even unintentionally) from a certain angle. Reflexivity to the audiotextual interfaces of description, indexing, and paratext engenders reflexivity to the values already ingrained in these actions: how they (purport to) create access to sound, which historically-situated paradigm of listening they encode, how they obscure (or do not obscure) the encounter with sounded alterity. Friction is produced in the gap between the easiest encounter with a given interface, and that which is the most reflexive. This may lead to a loss of theoretical rigor in my annotation methodology, or a lack of intelligibility. In part, these losses represent an encounter with alterity that leaves alterity intact."

I annotate each of the recordings, which I refer to using the arbitrary titles of Mic 1, Mic 2, and Mic 3.

In the poem, technological mediation functions to abstract, to distance the operators from the material implications of their digital actions.

Vocabularies for describing sound are often tied to functional need (e.g. transcripts for a podcast) or technological affordances (e.g. the parameters of a given metadata scheme). Vocabularies are also determined by the digital context in which the annotation exists, and the functional expectations of viewers/users. Here, the aim is ease of access, the smoothing over of the encounter between the reader of an annotation and the sound of an audiotext. Beyond vocabularies that are oriented solely toward functionality, there are several established ways for talking about sound in critical-analytical ways. One of the most common is prosody, which focuses on establishing metrical patterns in (most often) sounded poetry (Bernstein 14). Another form is transcription, which focuses on accessing sounded language for the purpose of analysis. Transcription “demand[s] a certain degree of envoicement from the reader” and may obscure the non-linguistic semiotic qualities of the audiotext (Camlot and Mitchell). Beyond these and other common forms, which reconstitute audiotext through/as its easily-describable traits, there have been attempts to create vocabularies that are holistically responsive to the semiotics of sound: Pierre Schaeffer proposes a classification system that describes sound independent of cause in his Traité des objets musicaux (Chion 27), and Bernstein cites Peters and Sherman’s sixty-character “special font to document the sounds, rhythms, and melodies of the Afro-poetic tradition” (16). On the whole, though, to write about sound in a way that centers its semiotic character tends to be—for lack of a better term—a bit clunky. This friction, or lack of fit at the interface between sound and written language, is what I explore as a means toward reflexivity."

Instead, I use my vocabulary to draw attention to the network of relations that produces sound through written language.

I demonstrate how these factors intertwine through two main features of my descriptive vocabulary: a focus on semiotic features and the use of general and relative language."

When spoken language is audible, it’s complicated by semiotic features, whether from other layers of sound or striking vocal modulation. For this reason, my annotation focuses on semiotic features of sound. This is most evident in my descriptions of speech, which use terms of volume, pitch, onset/offset, tone, and (occasionally) echo. I do not often transcribe language, except to illustrate one of these features. Here I draw on Charles Bernstein’s description of a “poetic mode of listening,” in which there is “an oscillation (or temporal overlap) between the materially present sound...and the absent meaning” (18). It’s for this reason, also, that I rarely use spatial descriptors (i.e. background, foreground) and I don’t often attribute sounds to specific sources. This practice is informed, in part, by Michel Chion’s reduced listening, which centers around “inherent qualities of sounds,” and which Chion places at odds with causal listening (i.e. listening for information about the source) and codal or semantic listening (i.e. listening for linguistic meaning) (29)."

It’s also true in the sense that there are causal and semantic descriptions mixed into my semiotic descriptions. In annotations for each audiotext, I use timbre descriptors like “electronic,” “brassy,” and “crunching,” which imply causes even if they don’t state them outright. When I use more specific images, I make them similes, as in “mid-pitch clicking sound, like ball bearings colliding” (Mic 2).

Beyond the authorized, monovocal elements that typical vocabularies focus on, the “Operator” recordings are open to unauthorized sound. Because of Avasilichioaei’s polyvocal, variable performance style, there is no clear delimitation—particularly in Mic 3 and Mic 1—between what is “of the performance” and what is incidental sound. The latter becomes part of each audiotext, according to the specific and variable situation of that audiotext in space and media. They are, in Bernstein’s description of the sounded poem, “always at the edge of semantic excess,” (13) open and inviting to what lies beyond. In recognition of the impossibility of putting the extra-semantic into language, I’ve selected descriptors that are relative and evidently subjective. Relative descriptors indicate the extent (“low,” “mid,” “high,” “soft,” “hard”) of qualities including pitch, volume, and onset/offset. I also variously use other relative descriptors (e.g. “sporadic”). This entails a loss of rigor—someone seeking to, for instance, digitally reconstruct the sounds solely from my annotations would find them wildly insufficient—but it opens up my annotations to multiple sonic possibilities, following the model of Avasilichioaei’s performance."

If I describe a sound as high volume, for instance, it’s because it sounded loud relative to the surrounding sounds, but also because there was likely a peak on the waveform at that point. When I struggled to discern features of the sound, I relied more heavily on the waveform and spectrogram. I don’t use numerical units like decibels—although they are measured by Audacity—because those units aren’t reflective of the way in which I used the technology, which wasn’t to isolate “absolute” features of the sound at a given moment in time, but to compare the sound across time. And, regardless, I don’t hear in decibels: using a technology like Audacity does not negate the affective experience of listening, despite the sheen of objectivity afforded by quantification. Furthermore, using precise units presumes precision that I didn’t have in my listening experience. For instance, I used Bluetooth headphones, which likely compressed the sound as I heard it, so what I saw on Audacity, even by the numbers, is not necessarily representative of what I heard."

Another is that, because they’re relative, readers seeking to understand any given description must engage with the surrounding annotations and perhaps also the audiotext itself. For instance, a high volume sound in the Mic 2 recording is louder than the Mic 1 recording, because the Mic 2 recording is generally louder. And, each of the audiotexts have loud sections around 0:40-0:50 and 2:20-2:30, which make the surrounding sounds seem quieter. A term like \"high volume\" is therefore used inconsistently by the standards of absolute volume, but consistently with my affective experience of the sound. This centers polyphony in a conceptual sense, as a deeper understanding of the sound comes from encountering multiple sources of sound: my annotations and the audiotexts themselves. Furthermore, it displaces meaning from any single location, written or sounded. This is a descriptive practice which, while lacking in rigor and not suited for all purposes, is consistent with the polyphony, fluidity, and openness of the audiotexts themselves."

Here, I am reflexive in my consideration of the contingency of accessing sound through control of its temporal situation. Unconstrained and on-demand access to sound is based on its status as a digital media object that can be saved, played, paused, rewinded, and excerpted. These actions are enabled by technology; although I focus on my use of Audacity, tech functions in other ways to encode sound as data, to package that data in a transferable and sustainable format, and to playback that data. In some instances, the effects of mediation can be present in a piece of audio. For instance, distortions in a wax cylinder can lead to audible cracks and humming. Wolfgang Ernst calls this “media-archeological information (about the physically real event)” (qtd. in Camlot 2). Although this is not the case for these recordings, I approach indexing in a similar way: it is information not about the live event of the performance, but rather the temporality of my own real listening event (and the subsequent creation of my annotations). I introduce time-based indexing in my discussion of excerpting, and further apply it to my timestamps, which are layered and variable-length."

To represent a time period as a duration entails a set of technologically mediated, time-based practices like pausing, clipping, and rewinding, which Kittler refers to as “time axis manipulation” (3). Both the original audio clips and my excerpted versions engender not only the possibility of, but the active use of time axis manipulation. The presence of an original and an excerpt implies the use of some technological means of cutting and then saving an excerpted form, which by this process of time axis manipulation is not merely a derivative of the original but a new audiotext in its own right. Thus the excerpt is both predicated on and subject to time axis manipulation in this project."

These labels appear in a fourth column in the annotations, giving readers a way to parse sounds based on timbre, not time. Speaking voices includes any vocalizations: live, recorded, or otherwise modulated. Electronic tones and distortions include any sounds with buzzy and/or synthetic timbre. Friction sounds refers to friction in the literal sense (distinct from the conceptual friction I've referred to).

Because noise is a social construct, what's noisy differs between situations and between people. Rather than imposing my definition of noise (or the definition that informs the development of audio editing software) readers of reflexive annotation may decide for themselves where the noise is (if it is present at all), possibly reassessing their own concept of noise."

In Mic 3, the noise seems to blend together, which is likely not a function of the noise being drastically different between the two audiotexts, but rather of the overall busier character of the Mic 3 audiotext. Where does this difference in the \"feel\" of the audiotexts come from? It could be differences in the recording devices, or their different placements in the room.

In this essay, itself a paratext of my annotations, I have attempted to frame reflexive annotation as a process of responsible creation of artifacts of a situated listening experience.

Epitext is material that is closely associated with the text, but outside the space of the volume (the book, or in this case this website) itself (264). Although this website can be accessed independently from the AVAnnotate website, the platform provides much of the framing for this project. AVAnnotate is oriented primarily towards researchers and scholars who want to create (not just view) annotations. Framing annotation as an end in itself highlights the critical-analytical and/or reflective possibilities engendered in the act of creating annotations. Consequently, AVAnnotate allows users lots of latitude in determining layout, appearance, and contextualizing information; while the AVAnnotate platform itself is used to upload indexed annotations, the project website can be edited in any number of ways via its linked GitHub repository. It’s a tool that doesn’t presume an end function, and as such it reorients (creative and receptive) focus to the process of creating and contextualizing annotations."

The Universal Viewer has more separation between the playback and the annotations, where the playback is at the top of the screen and the annotations follow. I use the Universal Viewer because it’s more practical for an audio-only project, but also because it visually separates the audio from the annotations. This separation supports the principle of responsibility to sounded alterity that I’ve used throughout this project, because it highlights that my annotations do not enter into the space or time of the audio itself, and rather serve as an exterior artifact of a mediated listening experience."

My annotations are not primarily about the sounds I listened to. They’re a document of the processes I undertook to attempt to inscribe those sounds in the most responsible way possible. Ultimately, and perhaps paradoxically, I find that to annotate reflexively means to give up the goal of accessing sound through written language.

These can be taken for granted with respect to print texts; I don’t remember any particular moment when I decided how I would write marginal notes in printed books, or which criteria I would use to pick out quotes from a text. When I annotate a print text, I rarely begin with a methodology in mind, even though my intuitive practices are just as contingent upon sociopolitical and epistemic aims as the audio-related practices I’ve discussed here. Working with audio is a less intuitive practice not because of some inherent incompatibility, but because of the friction between the print-related practices I know and the reality that digital audio is a completely different form of media."

From this lens, I can build a framework for writing about, indexing, and contextualizing work about audio that is less constrained by the norms of print.

Through reflexive annotation, listening is not a ephemeral, passive process of obtaining information but itself a product of its own situation. Furthermore, audiotexts are not resources to be drawn from and rendered obsolete via annotation; rather, they locate a web of discursive and material relations, which is remade differently each time it is entered into."

This decentralization brings the technologies I use under the umbrella of critical consideration. Both my process and the resulting annotations would have varied greatly if I used different tools, particularly in the case of AVAnnotate. As far as I’m aware, there isn’t another platform that is oriented specifically towards the creation of annotations for digital audio.
